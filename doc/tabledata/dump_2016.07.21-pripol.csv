To strengthen this security, we have developed a feature that allows you to have an additional level of safety: in our mobile application you can define a second password or, when it is possible, you can choose to use your fingerprint (stored only on your phone - we do not have access to it).\
\
We never save your contacts: the application accesses them to facilitate sharing but no data is accessible to us. Even when you challenge a friend, we do not retain this friend's data. We shall only use their information to send them your request.\

To guarantee the security of your data, they are stored and processed on our servers. Our servers are located within the European Union (France) and are therefore subject to regulations that guarantee you a high level of protection for your personal data.\

Access is strictly restricted and various security controls, consisting of security staff, security doors and biometric readers, must be passed. Remote access to the servers is highly restricted and controlled.",""
