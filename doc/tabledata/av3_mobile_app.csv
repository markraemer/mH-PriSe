also App is Xamarin based and running in Monodroid VM on Android which is some C style based implementation","tbd -- tbd"," -- passwords are just hased with MD5 no salt; after re login signature looks suspicious as no password is transmitted - seems to be generated based on current time, previous access token and some generat random number; but all this information is available to an attacker"," -- code is somewhat supprinsingly just a few lines and decompiled code doesn't show all the information
hence something must have been applied to the code
also certificate pinning is implemented and had to be removed in order to run further tests"," -- code shows many different frameworks and addons integrated with the solution (also see addons table)
the app itself shows less possibilities to make actually use of these frameworks and addons
the password seems to be MD5 hashed but since the communication is not encrypted and the hash is not randomiyed that is pointless, simply use the hash value to execute anything"," -- tbd"," -- java coding with native dependencies"
